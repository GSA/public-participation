<span style="color: #0f2a54"><strong>Metrics: How Do You Know You Successfully Established Goals?</strong></span>

Metrics will vary according to the platform you use. Some broad examples include:

  * Surveys – responses should drive learning and improvement.
  * Web – Google Analytics or heat-mapping shows participant engagement.
  * Email – click rates, bounce rates, unsubscribes, participation in a call-to-action.
  * Social Media – participant engagement analytics, reach, changing behavior, hashtag use.
  * Apps (native and mobile) – use statistics, are “transactions” being completed, is there input or feedback from the field (i.e. uploading multiple photos in citizen science app), are people actively using a native app (i.e. logging in multiple times).
  * Online Video Chats (i.e. hangouts) – participation rate, views.
  * Discussion Threads (i.e. chat rooms) – number of participants, input from the public, up votes/down votes.
  * Blog – viewership, comments, action audience takes next.
  * Transactional – hard numbers related to online transaction completion.
  * Rates of completion for public participation opportunities (e.g. Comment form submissions to federal agencies)
  * Rates of API participation and usage, e.g. number of API implementations, queries received via API, successful submissions received via API.
