    <span style="color: #333333">What is the U.S. Public Participation Playbook?</span>
  </h5>

  <p>
    <span style="color: #333333">The U.S. Public Participation Playbook is a resource for government managers to effectively evaluate and build better services through public participation using best practices and performance metrics.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="color: #333333">Public participation—where citizens help shape and implement government programs—is a foundation of open, transparent, and engaging government services. </span><span style="color: #333333">From emergency management, town hall discussions and regulatory development to science and education, better engagement with those who use public services can measurably improve those services for everyone. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="color: #333333">Developing a U.S. Public Participation Playbook is an <a style="color: #333333" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/04/30/open-government-public-participation-we-can-t-do-it-without-you">open government priority</a> included in both the first and second U.S. Open Government National Action Plans as part of the United States effort to increase public integrity in government programs. This resource reflects the commitment of the government and civic partners to measurably improve participation programs, and is designed using the same inclusive principles that it champions.</span>

  <h5>
    <span style="color: #333333">How is the playbook structured?</span>
  </h5>

  <p>
    <span style="color: #333333">We needed to create a resource that combines best practices and suggested performance metrics for public servants to use to evaluate and build better services &#8212; to meet this need, based on discussions with federal managers and stakeholders, we identified five main categories that should be addressed in all programs, whether digital or offline. Within each category we identified 12 unifying plays to start with, each including a checklist to consider, resources and training. We then provide suggested performance metrics for each main category. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="color: #333333">This is only the beginning, however, and we hope the plays will quickly expand and enrich. The U.S. Public Participation Playbook was not just designed for a more open government &#8212; it was designed collaboratively through a more open government. </span>
  </p>

  <h5>
    <span style="color: #333333">How was the playbook developed ?</span>
  </h5>

  <p>
    <span style="color: #333333">The U.S. Public Participation Playbook was created in an unprecedented collaboration of seventy federal managers from more than three dozen federal programs with more than a dozen citizen engagement experts from organizations including the OpenGov Foundation, the National Coalition for Dialogue & Deliberation, World Bank, Deliberative Democracy Consortium and the Sunlight Foundation. It was created in <a style="color: #333333" href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/12/17/3rd-u-s-public-participation-playbook-draft-released-this-month/">an open, transparent process</a> that included three public comment periods. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="color: #333333">While the playbook was developed for federal managers to use initially, we see immediate benefit in expanding and enriching the content with the perspectives and experiences of all levels of public service, both offline and digital &#8212; we invite you to help achieve this. </span>

### <span style="color: #0f2a54">Play 1: Clearly define and communicate your objectives</span> {#play1}

Federal agencies understand the importance of meaningful public engagement. The type of engagement will differ for each organization, depending on resources, audience and mission. Every agency must set goals that align with its unique definition of success and empowers the public to engage with agencies in order to influence government priorities.

**Checklist**

<ul class="check">
  <li>
    Identify what goal(s) you aim to achieve.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a plan that includes a timeline, and strategy &#8211; ramp up and drawdown.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluate organizational capacity for engaging and managing public participation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify internal and external stakeholders and partners.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluate and change strategy based on feedback and performance data.
  </li>
</ul>

<span style="color: #0f2a54"><strong>Metrics: How Do You Know You Successfully Established Goals?</strong></span>

Metrics will vary according to the platform you use. Some broad examples include:

  * Surveys – responses should drive learning and improvement.
  * Web – Google Analytics or heat-mapping shows participant engagement.
  * Email – click rates, bounce rates, unsubscribes, participation in a call-to-action.
  * Social Media – participant engagement analytics, reach, changing behavior, hashtag use.
  * Apps (native and mobile) – use statistics, are “transactions” being completed, is there input or feedback from the field (i.e. uploading multiple photos in citizen science app), are people actively using a native app (i.e. logging in multiple times).
  * Online Video Chats (i.e. hangouts) – participation rate, views.
  * Discussion Threads (i.e. chat rooms) – number of participants, input from the public, up votes/down votes.
  * Blog – viewership, comments, action audience takes next.
  * Transactional – hard numbers related to online transaction completion.
  * Rates of completion for public participation opportunities (e.g. Comment form submissions to federal agencies)
  * Rates of API participation and usage, e.g. number of API implementations, queries received via API, successful submissions received via API.

### <span style="color: #0f2a54">Play 2: Understand your participants and stakeholder groups</span> {#play2}

Community and stakeholder understanding is key to organizing a successful participatory effort. Once you determine who you&#8217;re trying to reach, you can refine your outreach efforts to effectively communicate with participants and stakeholders.

  </li>
  <li>
    Determine how you will reach diverse groups of people with broad perspectives.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify gatekeepers, including community groups, who can help reach potential participants.

### <span style="color: #0f2a54">Play 3: Understand and communicate the benefit of participation</span> {#play3}

Participants must understand how they can contribute to a program and why it is important they participate. Clearly defined and communicated benefits help craft effective messages and inclusive engagement. Understanding what successful participation looks like is critical to knowing whether your program succeeds.

**Checklist**

<ul class="check">
  <li>
    Decide what essential information participants need to know before engagement.
  </li>
  <li>
    Build a communications strategy that considers the expectations and motivations of participants and the value of participation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Involve senior leadership and ensure they understand the importance of participation.
  </li>

    Provide inclusive access to orientation materials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Define how participants benefit from the process and what they can contribute, including information, permission, and time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Inform participants when they should expect to hear follow-up from their engagement.
  </li>
  <li>
    Report how participation impacted program efforts.
  </li>
</ul>

### <span style="color: #0f2a54">Play 4: Empower participants through public/private partnership</span> {#play4}

Leveraging corporate and community partners is a powerful way of gaining support and participation for government campaigns and events.

**Checklist**

<ul class="check">
  <li>
    Define and create partnerships.
  </li>
  <li>
    Survey agency employees for knowledge of community and stakeholder groups.
  </li>

    Reach out to nonprofit organizations and community partners who can amplify participation opportunities and connect your agency with additional partners.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), an Interagency Agency Agreement (IAA), or another type of contractual agreement to describe each partner&#8217;s responsibilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    Outline the terms and the specifications of the partnership, including messaging, logo usage, promotional opportunities and boundaries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create an &#8220;authorized partners&#8221; list to reduce legal issues
  </li>
</ul>
