### <span style="color: #0f2a54"><strong>Metrics: How do you know you&#8217;re successfully facilitating participation?</strong></span>

  * Measure the % of decision-making processes &#8211; anything from project management to policy decisions–that have a public feedback track.
  * Measure how often &#8220;next steps&#8221; in a decision-making process are informed and prioritized in accordance with public feedback.
  * Measure how effective public feedback platforms and mediums are at reaching an equitable representation of the public.
  * Measure how the timing of public feedback solicitation affects the outcomes of decision-making processes.
  * Determine the value and effectiveness of the use of public feedback data, such as, but not limited to: Web Analytics, Emails, FOIA requests, popular datasets on Data.gov, as public sentiment indicators.
