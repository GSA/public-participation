### <span style="color: #0f2a54"><strong>Metrics: How do you know you successfully design participation?</strong></span>

  * Generate solid baseline data on how much your audience knows, and how well they responded to your message. This will help you determine whether public understanding of your message stayed the same or improved.
  * Analyze whether the program becomes integrated with participants or owned by the community.
  * Measure:
      * Readership/visits/participation in channels, i.e. programs, sites and blogs.
      * Awareness about the federal agency&#8217;s goals, mission, purpose, or resources.
      * Public participation (survey responses, event attendance, other contributions, i.e. time and ideas).
      * Volume of community organizations participating compared to previous programs.
      * Size of community that your partners reach
      * The role of public engagement in the planning/decision-making process.
      * Variation in percentage between current overall participation and previous efforts
      * Online engagement trends (e.g. comments and shares) over the entire length of the event.
      * Engagement across each channel, independently, to determine the level of participation on each.
